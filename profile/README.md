## Commit Message Guidelines

To keep our commit history clean and meaningful, please use the following commit message types:

- **[Add]**: For adding a new feature.
  - Example: `[Add]: User authentication feature`
- **[Update]**: For updating an existing feature or part of the code.
  - Example: `[Update]: Enhanced login security`
- **[Fix]**: For fixing bugs or issues.
  - Example: `[Fix]: Resolved signup form validation`
- **[Remove]**: For removing features or files.
  - Example: `[Remove]: Deprecated API endpoint`
- **[Temp]**: For temporary changes that will be removed later.
  - Example: `[Temp]: Add debug logs for testing`
- **[Wip]**: For work that is in progress.
  - Example: `[Wip]: Refactoring user profile module`

### Suggestions:

1. **[Add]** and **[Fix]** are essential and should definitely be kept as they cover adding new features and fixing issues.
2. **[Update]** is useful for non-bug changes to existing features.
3. **[Remove]** is good for tracking deletions.
4. **[Temp]** is helpful for marking temporary changes, but ensure these are reviewed and removed promptly.
5. **[Wip]** is useful for ongoing work, but it's good practice to complete tasks before committing. Use sparingly to avoid clutter.

Feel free to suggest additional commit message types if you think they are necessary!
